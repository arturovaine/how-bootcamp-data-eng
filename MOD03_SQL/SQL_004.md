## CTEs

## Common Table Expressions
OU
## Expressões de Tabela Comuns

---
```
"Uma CTE tem o uso bem similar ao de uma subquery ou tabela derivada, com a vantagem do conjunto de dados poder ser utilizado mais de uma vez na consulta, ganhando performance (nessa situação) e também, melhorando a legibilidade do código. Por estes motivos, o uso da CTE tem sido bastante difundido como substituição à outras soluções citadas." Dirceu Resende
```

- Sintaxe:

```sql
WITH expression_name [ ( column_name [,...n] ) ]
AS
( CTE_query_definition )
```

### Window Function
 
- Para que serve?

Poupar esforços em ações de ranqueamento e classificação dentro do banco de dados. Para isso, o Postgres cria uma partição dos dados(window).

Elas complementam as funções de SUM, COUNT, AVG, MAX e MIN.

Podem ser:

- numeração de registros: ROW_NUMBER()
- ranqueamento: RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), PERCENT_RANK()
- subdivisão: NTILE(), LAG(), lead)
- recuperação de registros: FIRST_VALUE(), LAST_VALUE(), NTH_VALUE()
- distancia relativa: CUME_DIST()

```sql
with CTE_BILLBOARD as (
select distinct
 t1.artist
 ,t1.song
FROM PUBLIC."Billboard" AS t1
order by t1.artist
 ,t1.song
)
select *
 ,row_number() over(order by artist, song) as "row_number"
 ,row_number() over(partition by artist order by artist, song) as

"row_number_by_artist"
 ,rank() over(partition by artist order by artist, song) as
"rank_artist"
 ,lag(song, 1) over(order by artist, song) as "lag_song"
 ,lead(song, 1) over(order by artist, song) as "lead_song"
 ,first_value(song) over(partition by artist order by artist, song) as
"first_song"
 ,last_value(song) over(partition by artist order by artist, song 
RANGE BETWEEN
 UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND
 UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) as "last_song"
 ,nth_value (song,2) over(partition by artist order by artist, song )
as "nth_song"
from CTE_BILLBOARD
```
